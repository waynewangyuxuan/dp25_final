# Logging Directory

This directory contains detailed log files generated by the experiment scripts. These logs are essential for tracking experiment progress, debugging, and maintaining a record of all experimental runs.

## Log File Structure

- Log files are named using the format: `{experiment_name}_{timestamp}.log`
- Each log file contains:
  - Experiment configuration and parameters
  - Progress updates during execution
  - Performance metrics and results
  - Any warnings or errors encountered
  - Timestamps for key events

## What are these Logs?

These log files are direct captures of the terminal output (stdout/stderr) during job execution. When you run any experiment script, all console output is automatically redirected to these log files. This means:
- Every print statement
- Every progress update
- Every error message
- Every warning
- All model outputs and metrics

This ensures you have a complete record of what happened during each experiment run, exactly as it appeared in the terminal.

## Available Logs

- `task1_baseline_*.log` - Baseline model evaluation logs
- `task2_fgsm_*.log` - FGSM attack experiment logs
- `task3_advanced_attack_*.log` - Advanced attack experiment logs
- `task4_pgd_patch_*.log` - PGD patch attack experiment logs
- `task5_transfer_*.log` - Transfer attack experiment logs

## Usage

The experiment scripts automatically redirect their stdout to these log files, preserving all console output for future reference. This ensures that no experimental data or debugging information is lost.
